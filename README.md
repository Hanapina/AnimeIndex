# AnimeIndex
This is a small program used to help people generate a list (in the form of a text file) and keep it organized (as for now this was built to keep the animes I've watched organized and to see what I have or not watched yet). I would put more functions in here but for now this is a WIP. 

If you want to actually create a build of the project yourself, you need to have following installed: 

* **Boost library (https://www.boost.org/)**
* **C++17 and above.**

## Installation 
Just put in a directory where you want the program to start creating your list. 
**Small note: the program is defaulted to create a ".txt" called "anime_index.txt."**

**If you do not want it named that, please change it via using the change entry option in the program before you use any of the other functions.**  

## Functions

1) Adding + Organizing the text file. 

2) Displaying the current text file.

3) Displaying your text files that you have in your current directory. 

4) Deleting an entry from your text file. **(This has to be matching case by case or an error will pop out, will think of a way to generate a less case sensitive matching later.)** 

5) Change the text file that you are currently working with.

6) Exit the program. 

## Disclaimer
You may use this however you want to but it would be great if you could credit me if you decide to fork this and use modify it.
