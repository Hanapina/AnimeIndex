# AnimeIndex
This is a small program used to help people generate a list (in the form of a text file) and keep it organized (as for now this was built to keep the animes I've watched organized and to see what I have or not watched yet). I would put more functions in here but for now this is a WIP. 

Next step is to implement a working GUI for this. 

If you want to create a build of the project yourself, you need to have following installed: 

* **JAVA SDK/SE8**
* **Program was exported via NetBeans.**

## Installation 
There will be a folder named "Anime_index_Java." 
There is a default text file created for you that also displays what format your items should be in if you want to explicitly import your own text file into it. 
**Small note: the program is defaulted to create a ".txt" called "anime_index.txt, if it does not exist."**

**IN TERMS OF FORMAT IN THE TEXT, IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE FOLLOWING: NAME, SEASON, YEAR**

## Functions

1) Adding + Organizing the text file. 

2) Displaying the current text file.

3) Soring your text file by either name, season, or year.

4) IN THE WORKS: Deleting an entry from your text file. **(This has to be matching case by case or an error will pop out, will think of a way to generate a less case sensitive matching later.)** 

5) Exit the program. 

## Disclaimer
You may use this however you want to but it would be great if you could credit me if you decide to fork this and use modify it. 
The whole project is zipped in a file and you can import it via netbeans if you feel like it. However, the original folder listed only contains the jar file.
